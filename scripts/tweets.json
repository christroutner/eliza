      "text": "If you don't own a rifle, your opinion is mostly irrelevant. \n\nEverything humans do to interact and work together is a proxy for force. \n\nForce is base-level communication, because it requires no common language or concepts, and it definitively settles every dispute. Problem with it is, it's risky, expensive, and mostly not very enjoyable.  \n\nSo we developed proxies for it. First language, then persuasion, deception, negotiation, money, blackmail, fake news, advertising, psychology, etc, etc, it's all a proxy for the underlying asset... force. \n\nSo if you have no weapon, then your opinion is only relevant when it influences those who do, whether directly or through second and higher order effects. \n\nThis places you at a considerable disadvantage, not only because those who can wield force directly can cut through the abstractions and wield that force directly, but also because the threat, stated or implied, of doing so carries weight and can change how others wield those higher-level abstractions. \n\nThis is why Jordan Peterson is wrong. \n\nFree speech, when available, can be used to defend many things, but when it is under threat, it cannot be used to defend itself. \n\nThe right to bear arms, however, can be used to defend the right to bear arms. \n\nAnd that is the difference. \n\nIf you need a further example, look at what is happening in Britain. The masters do not want their slaves expressing certain opinions, and they are imprisoning them for doing so. \n\nTheir real plan of attack, for course, has little to do with the people being imprisoned. They only have the resources to do that to a tiny fraction of the population. \n\nThe real plan is heads on spikes. It's using the fear of being one of those people to shut everyone up. Everyone but them. \n\nBut ask yourself... if you were British, or French, or Canadian, or Australian (or perhaps you actually are), instead of having the outrageous good fortune to be American, what the hell would you do?\n\nHow would you use the right of free speech to defend the right of free speech? If you say this is wrong, they'll find an excuse to call it hate speech and lock you up. \n\nAnd you consented to this, you morons. A few crazies shot a vanishingly small percentage of kids, and instead of locking up the crazies, like any sensible population, you let them take away your only capacity to resist them. \n\nYou cheered for it. \n\nYou begged for it. \n\nYou brag about it. \n\nYou try to snap back at us with it, saying that at least .00000000001% of your schoolchildren (in the ghetto) aren't being shot (by other feral teens in the ghetto), as third-world barbarians hack your little girls to death with machetes and rape your teenage daughters and your own government won't lift a finger to stop it, because they hate you and they want it to happen. \n\nYou don't want to admit that the primary civil right, the right on which all the others is based, is the right to be armed. \n\nBecause if you did, you would have to face three horrifying truths:\n\n1. You've been wrong all this time, and the very thing you were smuggest about was your biggest mistake. \n\n2. You are in a shit situation, because you now have to figure out how to bring down a government that hates you, can use force on you any time they want, and you can't stop them. \n\n3. America, Switzerland, and the Czech Republic are the only free countries on Earth. Everywhere else is a police state. \n\nAmericans have always known that ultimately, no matter who you are, now matter where you are, no one is coming to save you. You must possess the means to save yourself, or at least to fight back, to make yourself expensive and dangerous to kill, so you can save the next guy. \n\nThis is the reason, the real reason, why Americans love guns. \n\nWe let you pretend it was because we were fat stupid belligerent rednecks who like power fantasies, because that lie seemed to make you happy, and it's not nice to take away the comforting delusions of toddlers and crazy people. \n\nBut now that delusion is hurting you, and, contemptuous as you have been of us, you are fellow human beings, fellow civilized humans beings, and we don't want to see you die, so we have to tell you the truth. \n\nWe love guns because they are not only the tool of liberty, they are symbol of our value, not as tools or slaves of regime, but as independent, free human beings of inherent worth. \n\nIn America, when I walk past a police officer on the street, he has a badge and a gun. But I have a gun, too. Right there under my shirt. And my works just like his. \n\nAnd that changes everything. Because now I am not the only one dependent on the rule of law. He is dependent upon the rule of law, too. Because if the rule of law is the only thing that prevents him from killing me under color of authority, then the rule of law is the only thing that prevents me from killing him in the act of resistance. \n\nThe deterrents exist on both sides, and we all have to play nice. And mostly, we do. Because those deterrents make sure we really, really want to. \n\nThey're not playing nice any more on your side of the big blue wobbly thing. They have guns. All you have is a mouth and a keyboard. \n\nHow that working out for you? \n\nAn armed society is a polite society. That's not just a saying. That's not just fiction. \n\nAnd Terry Pratchett was dead wrong. It doesn't just last until \"some twerp drinks out of the wrong mug or picks up someone  else's change by mistake and five minutes later you're picking noses out of the beer nuts.\"\n\nOnly a person from a disarmed society, who has never lived in a armed one, could have been so profoundly, pig-headedly, disastrously delusional. \n\nIf you haven't trained with guns, owned guns, carried guns, you have no idea what they're like, or what you would do if you had one, or what everyone would do in a bar where everyone had one. \n\nBecause the answer, the real answer, to \"[what everyone does] in a pub where everyone goes armed\" is \"not get their goohuloog heads kicked in by the police for speaking out against their masters\".",

A few crazies shot a vanishingly small percentage of kids, and instead of locking up the crazies, like any sensible population, you let them take away your only capacity to resist them. <br><br>You cheered for it. <br><br>You begged for it. <br><br>You brag about it. <br><br>You try to snap back at us with it, saying that at least .00000000001% of your schoolchildren (in the ghetto) aren't being shot (by other feral teens in the ghetto), as third-world barbarians hack your little girls to death with machetes and rape your teenage daughters and your own government won't lift a finger to stop it, because they hate you and they want it to happen. <br><br>You don't want to admit that the primary civil right, the right on which all the others is based, is the right to be armed. <br><br>Because if you did, you would have to face three horrifying truths:<br><br>1. You've been wrong all this time, and the very thing you were smuggest about was your biggest mistake. <br><br>2. You are in a shit situation, because you now have to figure out how to bring down a government that hates you, can use force on you any time they want, and you can't stop them. <br><br>3. America, Switzerland, and the Czech Republic are the only free countries on Earth. Everywhere else is a police state. <br><br>Americans have always known that ultimately, no matter who you are, now matter where you are, no one is coming to save you. You must possess the means to save yourself, or at least to fight back, to make yourself expensive and dangerous to kill, so you can save the next guy. <br><br>This is the reason, the real reason, why Americans love guns. <br><br>We let you pretend it was because we were fat stupid belligerent rednecks who like power fantasies, because that lie seemed to make you happy, and it's not nice to take away the comforting delusions of toddlers and crazy people. <br><br>But now that delusion is hurting you, and, contemptuous as you have been of us, you are fellow human beings, fellow civilized humans beings, and we don't want to see you die, so we have to tell you the truth. <br><br>We love guns because they are not only the tool of liberty, they are symbol of our value, not as tools or slaves of regime, but as independent, free human beings of inherent worth. <br><br>In America, when I walk past a police officer on the street, he has a badge and a gun. But I have a gun, too. Right there under my shirt. And my works just like his. <br><br>And that changes everything. Because now I am not the only one dependent on the rule of law. He is dependent upon the rule of law, too. Because if the rule of law is the only thing that prevents him from killing me under color of authority, then the rule of law is the only thing that prevents me from killing him in the act of resistance. <br><br>The deterrents exist on both sides, and we all have to play nice. And mostly, we do. Because those deterrents make sure we really, really want to. <br><br>They're not playing nice any more on your side of the big blue wobbly thing. They have guns. All you have is a mouth and a keyboard. <br><br>How that working out for you? <br><br>An armed society is a polite society. That's not just a saying. That's not just fiction. <br><br>And Terry Pratchett was dead wrong. It doesn't just last until \"some twerp drinks out of the wrong mug or picks up someone  else's change by mistake and five minutes later you're picking noses out of the beer nuts.\"<br><br>Only a person from a disarmed society, who has never lived in a armed one, could have been so profoundly, pig-headedly, disastrously delusional. <br><br>If you haven't trained with guns, owned guns, carried guns, you have no idea what they're like, or what you would do if you had one, or what everyone would do in a bar where everyone had one. <br><br>Because the answer, the real answer, to \"[what everyone does] in a pub where everyone goes armed\" is \"not get their goohuloog heads kicked in by the police for speaking out against their masters\".",

      "text": "I know I'm supposed to be all cheerful today, given Bitcoin's entered a new epoch. As the Halving is now behind us. \n\nBut there are a bunch of things about this epoch that make me quite uncomfortable. \n\nFirst of all, what we are seeing today, fees north of $100 USD to get a transaction on chain, isn't a fad. It is the future of a successful Bitcoin. \n\nWhile it may be a jpeg craze that's bringing that future to us today, any real adoption of Bitcoin would deliver us there anyway. \n\nThere is a rare gift in this jpeg and ponzi insanity, with eth noobs burning millions of dollars on crap that will go to zero in a few months. \n\nAnd I for one, thank them for their sacrifice. \n\nBut will we take this gift and use it, or let it go to waste?  \n|\nWhat consequences do high fees have on Bitcoin's user base and utility today and in the future?\n\nWell, most normal people are priced out of Bitcoin as we speak. $100 tx fees are more expensive than pretty much all other ways to transfer money online today. \n\nLayer 2 protocols like the lightning network have to work and carry that burden, but as it stands, the LN network can't carry it either. \n\nLN's security model depends on being able to settle disputes on chain, if the on chain fees are too high, the cost of justice becomes the same as the cost of theft. And thus there is no justice. \n\nThe solutions being thrown around are not great. \n\nThe big blockers think more on chain capacity will solve it, but that's questionable. \n\nEthereum has 12 second blocks 2mb thick, with variable block size, and still can't move ETH for less than $16 dollars on a Tuesday. Let alone a future where the world's economy depends on it. \n\nFurther more, degens are clearly willing to spend insane amounts of money to degen. Gambling is a usecase and is probably as old as prostitution. \n\nThe history of this industry is littered with shtcoins, and I see no evidence that that will change any time soon.\n\nWhile the colors and names of the xeetcoins change, their form and end continue to be the same and continue to manifest. If 100 million people are using crypto today, then there's still another 8 billion to go, whom have to gamble their way out of stupidity and into a recognition of the value of hard money. \n\nIf most maximalists came here after getting burned with shtcoins, then we still have 100 years of shtcoins to go, before the world gets a little wiser.  \n\nSo, even with big blocks, degens will still fill them up with garbage, and gamble their money away, for the chance to make it big. \n\nNot all people, but enough of them. The blocks will get full no matter how big. Look at solana, a chaos of MEV and meme coins. Impossible to sync. \n\nSo if we increase the blocks, syncing and verifying the integrity of Bitcoin becomes a luxury, and if we don't find a way to scale self custody, then all we have left is the ability to verify the integrity of Bitcoin used by Bitcoin Banks who will get regulated and KYCed. \n\nIf we can't have cost effective self custody, then what's the point syncing a full node? To verify the supply of a Bitcoin that can be fractionally reserved by Bitcoin banks anyway? \n\nThe threads become somewhat undone. Maybe Hal is right that a free market of banks can find equilibrium. \n\nMaybe a world where Bitcoin ownership scales through Bitcoin banks, would be better than fiat. I believe it would. But losing self custody would be disappointing anyway, wouldn't it.\n\nSo let's filter the chain right? what does that even mean? There are no soft fork or even hard fork upgrades to Bitcoin that I'm aware of that can keep the shtcoiners away. Bitcoin is a digital environment, a data base at the end of the day, you could put completely legit transactions on it and have a second layer of interpretation distort their 'legal' value. As demonstrated by rare sats. \n\nYou can call rare sats a scam all you want, but collectors DGAF.

      "html": "I know I'm supposed to be all cheerful today, given Bitcoin's entered a new epoch. As the Halving is now behind us. <br><br>But there are a bunch of things about this epoch that make me quite uncomfortable. <br><br>First of all, what we are seeing today, fees north of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24100\">$100</a> USD to get a transaction on chain, isn't a fad. It is the future of a successful Bitcoin. <br><br>While it may be a jpeg craze that's bringing that future to us today, any real adoption of Bitcoin would deliver us there anyway. <br><br>There is a rare gift in this jpeg and ponzi insanity, with eth noobs burning millions of dollars on crap that will go to zero in a few months. <br><br>And I for one, thank them for their sacrifice. <br><br>But will we take this gift and use it, or let it go to waste?  <br>|<br>What consequences do high fees have on Bitcoin's user base and utility today and in the future?<br><br>Well, most normal people are priced out of Bitcoin as we speak. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24100\">$100</a> tx fees are more expensive than pretty much all other ways to transfer money online today. <br><br>Layer 2 protocols like the lightning network have to work and carry that burden, but as it stands, the LN network can't carry it either. <br><br>LN's security model depends on being able to settle disputes on chain, if the on chain fees are too high, the cost of justice becomes the same as the cost of theft. And thus there is no justice. <br><br>The solutions being thrown around are not great. <br><br>The big blockers think more on chain capacity will solve it, but that's questionable. <br><br>Ethereum has 12 second blocks 2mb thick, with variable block size, and still can't move ETH for less than <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%2416\">$16</a> dollars on a Tuesday. Let alone a future where the world's economy depends on it. <br><br>Further more, degens are clearly willing to spend insane amounts of money to degen. Gambling is a usecase and is probably as old as prostitution. <br><br>The history of this industry is littered with shtcoins, and I see no evidence that that will change any time soon.<br><br>While the colors and names of the xeetcoins change, their form and end continue to be the same and continue to manifest. If 100 million people are using crypto today, then there's still another 8 billion to go, whom have to gamble their way out of stupidity and into a recognition of the value of hard money. <br><br>If most maximalists came here after getting burned with shtcoins, then we still have 100 years of shtcoins to go, before the world gets a little wiser.  <br><br>So, even with big blocks, degens will still fill them up with garbage, and gamble their money away, for the chance to make it big. <br><br>Not all people, but enough of them. The blocks will get full no matter how big. Look at solana, a chaos of MEV and meme coins. Impossible to sync. <br><br>So if we increase the blocks, syncing and verifying the integrity of Bitcoin becomes a luxury, and if we don't find a way to scale self custody, then all we have left is the ability to verify the integrity of Bitcoin used by Bitcoin Banks who will get regulated and KYCed. <br><br>If we can't have cost effective self custody, then what's the point syncing a full node? To verify the supply of a Bitcoin that can be fractionally reserved by Bitcoin banks anyway? <br><br>The threads become somewhat undone. Maybe Hal is right that a free market of banks can find equilibrium. <br><br>Maybe a world where Bitcoin ownership scales through Bitcoin banks, would be better than fiat. I believe it would. But losing self custody would be disappointing anyway, wouldn't it.<br><br>So let's filter the chain right? what does that even mean? There are no soft fork or even hard fork upgrades to Bitcoin that I'm aware of that can keep the shtcoiners away. Bitcoin is a digital environment, a data base at the end of the day, you could put completely legit transactions on it and have a second layer of interpretation distort their 'legal' value. As demonstrated by rare sats. <br><br>You can call rare sats a scam all you want, but collectors DGAF. The first sat of this new epoch is special and as long as enough people agree on which sat that is, it will have more value than other sats. Collector's value. <br><br>The history of money is also littered with collector's pieces. From special gold jewelry to silver coins, to historical bills that are no longer in circulation. I see no reason to think Bitcoin will be different in this regard, if it really is a form of money.<br><br>But let's filter everything we can anyway, let's build a filtering engine that can update it's self to the innovations of the gamblers, they say.
